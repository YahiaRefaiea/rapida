# Rapida

Rapid JavaScript development environment for building RESTful API.

## Description

Developing a complete Javascript project can be burdensome, even though `nodejs` provides a good boilerplate code to begin with.
but this boilerplate code needs to be written every single time,we want to build  a new project which contradicts with the 1st role in programming "Do Not repeat yourself".
that's why we created `Rapida`  a Js library that helps eliminating boilerplate code and helps you focus on developing your logic code as much as possible rather than spending time maintaining boilerplate code.

this library contains several modules, so you can pick and choose what suits you based on your project.
